# ReadWeekly
A frontend project to set and track weekly readinig goals using React and Expo! Created to fix some of the major bugs and issues in the popular 'Goodreads' app, and to strengthen my javascript and web/mobile development knowledge.

## End result!
While the project is still in progress, here is the current development of the home page!
